I have chosen to use my own textures.
I have uploaded only the files I had changed.

Notes for assignment 3 (still relevant)
Please note, the chain is trying to reach the center of the destination cube, upon activating the IK solver. Thus, it is possible that a "cannot reach" message will be printed even though it can clearly be seen that the chain can reach the destination cube. This is because it cannot reach the *center* of the cube.

As I understood from Tamir when I asked him during office hours, I programmed the mouse functions such that the mouse button (left or right) must be hold in order for the relevant function to be activated.
